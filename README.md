# SimulationHighFive
Simulation of improved safety of node Am Fuchsberg / Leipziger str/ Erich-Weinert Str in magdeburg, saxony-anhalt , germany with the changes that is recommended after performing numerous experiments and analyzing past traffic data provided by the  City Planning Office, Magdeburg.

## Milestone 1 : Team Formation

* Sitashma Rajbhandari - Conceptual Model Designer
* Hamza Rafiq - Data Analyst
* Sreekar Indarapu - Chief Software Architect
* Joel John Philip - Validation Expert
* Srilekha Tummala - Experiment Designer
* Nitin Hegde - Team Leader

## Milestone 2 : Project Plans

The tasks were divided into several work packets and assigned to the respective roles along with the time duration and priority status for each task. <br/> 
Project cost estimate = 60,000 euros <br/> 
Man-hour = 100 euros


## Milestone 3 : Conceptual Model

Using Petrinet, a conceptual model (abstraction of the real system ) for the traffic node Am Fuchsberg/LeipgzerStr/Erich-Weinert.Str was built 
* all assumptions made with reasons and justifications
* the quantities to be measured
* the quantities that will be used as simulation results
* the experiments that will be performed

## Milestone 4 : Data Analysis

Data were collected in the peak hours (7:00 am -8:00am) to accord with the data provided by the City Office. 
* the values of the input and output variables that were measured
* any other measurements
* difficulties encountered while obtaining the data
* limitations on the accuracy or validity of the data

## Milestone 5: Simulation Model

* the program concept and structure
* modularization or other special issues
* differences to the conceptual model
* steps taken to verify the program
* any particular difficulties encountered

## Milestone 6: Validation
* Description, justification and results of the validation experiments
* Comparisons of real and simulated data, if any
* Any corrections made to your model or data
* Statement of confidence in your simulation model
* Limitations on the scope of the validity

## Milestone 7: Experiments
* Prove (or disprove) claims about the system.
* Provide the basis for recommendations.
* Description, justification and results of experiments performed
* Values of all variables of interest + Statement of accuracy (e.g. confidence intervals)

## Milestone 8: Final Presentation
* Explaining and justifying the recommendations.
